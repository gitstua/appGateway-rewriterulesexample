# Example template to deploy rewrite rules to Azure App Gateway

This example shows a rewriteRuleSet that replaces **www.microsoft.com** with **www.bing.com** in the [HTTP redirect response](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_301)

There is a [quickstart template](https://github.com/Azure/azure-quickstart-templates/tree/master/101-application-gateway-rewrite) but this repo explains how to rewrite a redirect location header.
